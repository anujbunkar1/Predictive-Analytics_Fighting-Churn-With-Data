# Predictive Analytics : Fighting Churn With Data

This workbook explains customer churn, a critical issue that can significantly impact a business's bottom line. Customer churn refers to the number of customers who leave a company during a given time period, and it can have a significant impact on a company's revenues and profits.

As McKinsey & Co stated, companies either grow fast or die slow. They recommend focusing on customer retention to achieve fast growth: “Technology and software companies spend millions acquiring new customers, yet customer retention is what separates top performers from their competitors.” This indicates that only companies who have successfully dealt with customer churn have sustained growth throughout time.

The cost of customer churn is staggering. According to Forrester, it costs 5 times more to acquire new customers than it does to keep an existing one. In addition, it costs companies 16 times more to bring a new customer up to the same level as an existing customer. Furthermore, the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%, while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5-20%.

Startups, in particular, face a high churn rate. Majority of startups face 60% churn rate, owing to instability in early stage startups and the highly competitive market.

To prevent customer churn, companies need to implement a retention strategy and have a prediction model in place which could tell which customers are at risk of leaving, so that they can take action to retain them before it's too late. This workbook is designed to help companies and startups in achieving that by providing end-to-end guidance on how to predict customer churn and implement a retention strategy. It includes data analysis, data visualization, and prediction modeling techniques to help companies understand the underlying reasons for customer churn and take action to prevent it.

This workbook explains how companies and startups can effectively manage customer churn, lower their customer acquisition costs, and increase their customer retention rates by just deploying a simple linear regression model. This will not only help them save millions of dollars but also help them achieve long-term, sustained growth.
